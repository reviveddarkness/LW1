**How to Run Perl Scripts:**
- Every modern Linux and Mac distribution comes with the newest version of a perl interpreter installed. However, 
  if you are installing an older release of a linux or mac distribution then you may need to update your perl version. 
  This can be checked with perl -v.
- You can install packages for Windows or find updates for Mac and Linux through [perl.org’s](https://www.perl.org/get.html) provided binaries. 
- You run an executable for the Windows Installation.
- If you already have Perl installed you can use cpan[1]> upgrade to update your existing version to the most latest. 
  However, updating your operating system should include these updates automatically. (Unless you’re on Windows)
- Once Perl is installed and updated, you can run programs with the command perl -- filename. For additional run parameters, 
  which you definitely shouldn’t need, you should consult perl documentation.
- Perl is an interpreted language, so you can simply run the source file using the above command for all examples and it will 
  function. There is no compilation (build) process.
- The recommended Perl IDE if you have to make changes to the source scripts is Padre, however Perl programs can be edited with 
  any advanced text editor such as Notepad++.
